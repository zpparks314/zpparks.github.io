Hello! I am a Ph.D. student at North Carolina State University. I am a member of Dr. Dreher's research group at NCSU and my research interests revolve around quantum computing, including software, applications, and noise and error mitigation. Currently, my work involves investigating quantum computing noise and error mitigation strategies on physics applications using pulse programming.  

I enjoy music, the outdoors, and spending time with family and friends.
