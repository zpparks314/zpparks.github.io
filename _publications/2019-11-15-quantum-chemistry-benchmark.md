We present a quantum chemistry benchmark for noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers that leverages the variational
quantum eigensolver, active-space reduction, a reduced unitary coupled cluster ansatz, and reduced density purification as error
mitigation. We demonstrate this benchmark using 4 of the available qubits on the 20-qubit IBM Tokyo and 16-qubit Rigetti Aspen
processors via the simulation of alkali metal hydrides (NaH, KH, RbH), with accuracy of the computed ground state energy serving as
the primary benchmark metric. We further parameterize this benchmark suite on the trial circuit type, the level of symmetry
reduction, and error mitigation strategies. Our results demonstrate the characteristically high noise level present in near-term
superconducting hardware, but provide a relevant baseline for future improvement of the underlying hardware, and a means for
comparison across near-term hardware types. We also demonstrate how to reduce the noise in post processing with specific error
mitigation techniques. Particularly, the adaptation of McWeeny purification of noisy density matrices dramatically improves
accuracy of quantum computations, which, along with adjustable active space, significantly extends the range of accessible
molecular systems. We demonstrate that for specific benchmark settings and a selected range of problems, the accuracy metric can
reach chemical accuracy when computing over the cloud on certain quantum computers.
